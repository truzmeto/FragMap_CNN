Prediction of fragment free energy maps from protein structure with ConvNet

## Note to repo admins: :point_up: 

__This repo must be kept clean and organized! Please do not change original functions!__
__If you do change them, keep it for your own use, and don't push it here.  You can__
__only push required tasks, while making sure that your code satisfy the following:__

* Code must be both memory and speed efficient 
* Code must be easily redable, clean
* Every function needs unittest, which validates its correctness!
* All arithmethic operations performed on grid(usually large(100x100x100))
  must be done with torch.cuda()! 


### Main Requirements:
- `python`  3.6 >
- `PyTorch` 
- `cuda-10` 
- `gcc` 7 >  
- `TorchProteinLibrary`
- `PyVista`
